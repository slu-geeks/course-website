                        <ul>
                        	<li>It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope,that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies.</li>
                        	<li>A global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide</li>
                        	<li>A means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world via dedicated routers and servers. When two computers are connected over the Internet, they can send and receive all kinds of information such as text, graphics, voice, video, and computer programs.

                        <b>The World Wide Web</b>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>A global information medium which users can read and write via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, as e-mail does.</li>
                        	<li>In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) and the European Commission. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>
                        <p>Tim Berners-Lee is credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web. A physicist, Berners-Lee and his team built the world's very first web browser, WorldWideWeb, the first web server and the HyperText-based markup language HTML. Berners-Lee founded and is the current director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a standards body that oversees the development of the web as a whole. While the Internet itself dates back 1969, it was Berners-Lee who was able to bring together the concept of the Internet and hypertext, which set the foundation for the Internet as we know it today.</p>

                        <b>Internet vs. The World Wide Web</b>
                        <p>The Internet is not synonymous with World Wide Web. The Internet is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to the Internet. The World Wide Web, or simply Web, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the Internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the Internet.</p>

                        <b>IoT (Internet of Things)</b>
                        <p>The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. In 2013 the Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things (IoT-GSI) defined the IoT as "the infrastructure of the information society." The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure,[4] creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention.When IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.</p>

                                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

                            <p>Since 1990 the HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative. The HTTP/0.9, the first version of HTTP, was simple protocol for raw data transfer accros the Internet. HTTP 1.0 improved the protocol by allowing mesages to be in the format of MIME-like messages, containing metainformation about the data transferred and modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual hosts.</p>
                            
                            <p>HTTP allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the purpose of a request. It builds on the discipline of reference provided by the Unifromat Resource Identifier (URI), as a location (URL) or name (URN), for indiciating the resource to which a method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to that used by Internet mail as defined by the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).</p>
                            
                            <p>HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between user agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet systems, including those supported by the SMTP, NNTP, FTP, Gopher, and WAIS protocols. In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia access to resources available from diverse applications.
                            </p>

                                  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. In simple terms, HTML constructs web pages.
                                  Hypertext means that documents are designed to be linked to other documents on the web.
                                  Next is HTML being a markup language which are the set of tags that are added to the
                                  text of a webpage to define its structure which are critical roles. First, it defines
                                  the role each piece of content will have. Some content will become the main headline,
                                  while other content links in the navigation. Some tags describe non-textual elements and so on.

                                  It's Time Berners-Lee! Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the Web. In 1989, Tim was
                                  working in a computing services section of CERN when he came up with the concept;
                                  at the time he had no idea that it would be implemented on such an enormous scale.
                                  Particle physics research often involves collaboration among institutes from all over
                                  the world. Tim had the idea of enabling researchers from remote sites in the world to
                                  organize and pool together information. But far from simply making available a large
                                  number of research documents as files that could be downloaded to individual computers,
                                  he suggested that you could actually link the text in the files themselves.
                                  In other words, there could be cross-references from one research paper to another.
                                  This would mean that while reading one research paper, you could quickly display part
                                  of another paper that holds directly relevant text or diagrams. Documentation of a
                                  scientific and mathematical nature would thus be represented as a `web' of information
                                  held in electronic form on computers across the world. This, Tim thought, could be
                                  done by using some form of hypertext, some way of linking documents together by using
                                  buttons on the screen, which you simply clicked on to jump from one paper to another.
                                  Before coming to CERN, Tim had already worked on document production and text processing,
                                  and had developed his first hypertext system, `Enquire', in 1980 for his own personal use.

                                    The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request. Following are the most commonly used forms to specify an URI: Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
                                    
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                The exact resource identified by an Internet request is determined by examining both the Request-URI and the Host header field.

                                The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as request modifiers, with semantics equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method invocation.

                        <p>
                            After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message.
                            
                            <p>

                        <li><b>Status-Line</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line, consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase, with each element separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.
                            </p>

                                    The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request. The Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the Status-Code. The Status-Code is intended for use by automata and the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. The client is not required to examine or display the Reason- Phrase.The request method indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive and should always be mentioned in uppercase.

                                The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line. These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.

                            Request and Response messages MAY transfer an entity if not otherwise restricted by the request method or response status code. An entity consists of entity-header fields and an entity-body, although some responses will only include the entity-headers.

                        <p>
                            Entity-header fields define metainformation about the entity-body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request. Some of this metainformation is OPTIONAL; some might be REQUIRED by portions of this specification.
                            </p>

                                    The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional content codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing the identity of its underlying media type. 
                                </p>

                                    The Content-Language entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Note that this might not be equivalent to all the languages used within the entity-body.
                                </p>

                                    The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET.
                                </p>

                                    The Content-Location entity-header field MAY be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. A server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the variant corresponding to the response entity; especially in the case where a resource has multiple entities associated with it, and those entities actually have separate locations by which they might be individually accessed, the server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the particular variant which is returned.

                                    The Content-MD5 entity-header field, as defined in RFC 1864, is an MD5 digest of the entity-body for the purpose of providing an end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body.
                                </p>

                                    The Content-Range entity-header is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied.
                                </p>
                                <li>Content-Type</li>

                                    The Content-Type entity-header field indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET.
                                </p>

                                    The Expires entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. A stale cache entry may not normally be returned by a cache (either a proxy cache or a user agent cache) unless it is first validated with the origin server (or with an intermediate cache that has a fresh copy of the entity).
                                </p>
                                <li>Last-Modified</li>
                                <p>
                                    The Last-Modified entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified.
                                </p>

                                    The extension-header mechanism allows additional entity-header fields to be defined without changing the protocol, but these fields cannot be assumed to be recognizable by the recipient. Unrecognized header fields SHOULD be ignored by the recipient and MUST be forwarded by transparent proxies.
                                </p>

                                    The entity-body (if any) sent with an HTTP request or response is in a format and encoding defined by the entity-header fields. An entity-body is only present in a message when a message-body is present. The entity-body is obtained from the message-body by decoding any Transfer-Encoding that might have been applied to ensure safe and proper transfer of the message.
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line. These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.

                                    When an entity-body is included with a message, the data type of that body is determined via the header fields Content-Type and Content- Encoding.

                                    The entity-length of a message is the length of the message-body before any transfer-codings have been applied. Section 4.4 defines how the transfer-length of a message-body is determined.

                                    Prior to persistent connections, a separate TCP connection was established to fetch each URL, increasing the load on HTTP servers and causing congestion on the Internet. The use of inline images and other associated data often require a client to make multiple requests of the same server in a short amount of time. Analysis of these performance problems and results from a prototype implementation are available. Implementation experience and measurements of actual HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2068) implementations show good results. Alternatives have also been explored, for example, T/TCP.

                                        waiting for each response, allowing a single TCP connection to
                                        be used much more efficiently, with much lower elapsed time.

                                        Network congestion is reduced by reducing the number of packets
                                        caused by TCP opens, and by allowing TCP sufficient time to
                                        determine the congestion state of the network.

                                        Latency on subsequent requests is reduced since there is no time

                                        HTTP can evolve more gracefully, since errors can be reported
                                        without the penalty of closing the TCP connection. Clients using
                                        future versions of HTTP might optimistically try a new feature,
                                        but if communicating with an older server, retry with old
                                        semantics after an error is reported.

                                    A significant difference between HTTP/1.1 and earlier versions of HTTP is that persistent connections are the default behavior of any HTTP connection. That is, unless otherwise indicated, the client SHOULD assume that the server will maintain a persistent connection, even after error responses from the server.

                                    Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes place using the Connection header field. Once a close has been signaled, the client MUST NOT send any more requests on that connection.

If the server chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the response, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the connection-token close.

                                        A client that supports persistent connections MAY "pipeline" its requests (i.e., send multiple requests without waiting for each response). A server MUST send its responses to those requests in the same order that the requests were received.

                                    It is especially important that proxies correctly implement the properties of the Connection header field. The proxy server MUST signal persistent connections separately with its clients and the origin servers (or other proxy servers) that it connects to. Each persistent connection applies to only one transport link.
                                    A proxy server MUST NOT establish a HTTP/1.1 persistent connection with an HTTP/1.0 client (but see RFC 2068 [33] for information and discussion of the problems with the Keep-Alive header implemented by many HTTP/1.0 clients).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making more connections through the same server. The use of persistent connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of this time-out for either the client or the server.<br>

                                    When a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful close on the transport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource drain on the network.<br>

                                    A client, server, or proxy MAY close the transport connection at any time. For example, a client might have started to send a new request at the same time that the server has decided to close the "idle" connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a request is in progress.

                                HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD maintain persistent connections and use TCP's flow control mechanisms to resolve temporary overloads, rather than terminating connections with the expectation that clients will retry. The latter technique can exacerbate network congestion.

                                    An HTTP/1.1 (or later) client sending a message-body SHOULD monitor the network connection for an error status while it is transmitting the request. If the client sees an error status, it SHOULD immediately cease transmitting the body. If the body is being sent using a "chunked" encoding, a zero length chunk and empty trailer MAY be used to prematurely mark the end of the message. If the body was preceded by a Content-Length header, the client MUST close the connection.

                                    The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status is to allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject the message without looking at the body.
