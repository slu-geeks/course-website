                            These are the key ingredients and must have tools for CSS development.
                            Pre-processors extend CSS with variables, operators, interpolations, functions, mixins and
                            many more other usable assets. <i>SASS, LESS</i> and <i>Stylus </i>are the well known ones.

                            <h4>Why Pre-Processing CSS?</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            Pre-processors, together with their advanced features, helped to achieve writing reusable,
                            maintainable and extensible codes in CSS. By using a pre-processor, you can easily increase
                            your productivity, and decrease the amount of code you are writing in a project.

                            <h4>SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <td><img src="../../public/img/sass.png" alt="sass"></td>

                                        SASS is more popular than Less. It is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional
                                        grade CSS extension language in the world. Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted
                                        into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists
                                        of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called <i>"the indented syntax"</i>, uses a syntax similar to
                                        Haml.It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules.
                                        The newer syntax, <b>"SCSS"</b>, uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to
                                        denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and
                                        SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.

                                </tr>
                            </table>
                        </div><br/>
                        <div>
                            <h4>LESS</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <td><img src="../../public/img/less.png" alt="less"></td>
                                    <td>
                                        Less is influenced by Sass and has influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which adapted its
                                        CSS-like block formatting syntax. Less is open source. Its first version was written in Ruby;
                                        however, in the later versions, use of Ruby has been deprecated and replaced by JavaScript. The
                                        indented syntax of Less is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid Less code with the same
                                        semantics. Less provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, operators and
                                        functions; the main difference between Less and other CSS precompilers being that Less allows
                                        real-time compilation via less.js by the browser.
