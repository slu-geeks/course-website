                        JavaScript includes data types similar to other programming languages like Java or C#. Data type indicates characteristics of data. It tells the compiler whether the data value is numeric, alphabetic, date etc., so that it can perform the appropriate operation.<br>
                        <br>
                        JavaScript includes primitive and non-primitive data types as per latest ECMAScript 5.1.
                        </p>

                                    A string value is a chain of zero or more Unicode characters (letters, digits, and punctuation marks). You use the string data type to represent text in JavaScript. You include string literals in your scripts by enclosing them in single or double quotation marks. Double quotation marks can be contained in strings surrounded by single quotation marks, and single quotation marks can be contained in strings surrounded by double quotation marks. The following are examples of strings:
                     
                                    <pre>
                                    "Happy am I; from care I'm free!"  
                                    '"Avast, ye lubbers!" roared the technician.'   
                                    "45"  
                                    'c'
                                    </pre>

                                    Notice that JavaScript does not have a type to represent a single character. To represent a single character in JavaScript, you create a string that consists of only one character. A string that contains zero characters ("") is an empty (zero-length) string.
                                    JavaScript provides escape sequences that you can include in strings to create characters that you cannot type directly.<br>

                                        In JavaScript, there is no distinction between integer and floating-point values; a JavaScript number can be either (internally, JavaScript represents all numbers as floating-point values). <br>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                                        <li><b>Integer Values</b></li><br>
                                        Integer values can be positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers, and 0. They can be represented in base 10 (decimal), base 16 (hexadecimal), and base 8 (octal). Most numbers in JavaScript are written in decimal.
                                        You denote hexadecimal ("hex") integers by prefixing them with a leading "0x" (zero and x|X). They can contain digits 0 through 9, and letters A through F (either uppercase or lowercase) only. The letters A through F are used to represent, as single digits, 10 through 15 in base 10. That is, 0xF is equivalent to 15, and 0x10 is equivalent to 16.
                                        You denote octal integers by prefixing them with a leading "0" (zero). They can contain digits 0 through 7 only. A number that has a leading "0" and contains the digits "8" and/or "9" is interpreted as a decimal number.
                                        Both hexadecimal and octal numbers can be negative, but they cannot have a decimal portion, and they cannot be written in scientific (exponential) notation.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <li><b>Floating-point Values</b></li><br>
                                        Floating-point values can be whole numbers with a decimal portion. Additionally, they can be expressed in scientific notation. That is, an uppercase or lowercase "e" is used to represent "ten to the power of". JavaScript represents numbers using the eight byte IEEE 754 floating-point standard for numerical representation. This means you can write numbers as large as 1.79769x10308, and as small as 5x10-324. A number that contains a decimal point and that has a single "0" before the decimal point is interpreted as a decimal floating-point number.
                                        Notice that a number that begins with "0x" or "00" and contains a decimal point will generate an error.

                                        Whereas the string and number data types can have a virtually unlimited number of different values, the Boolean data type can only have two. They are the literals true and false. A Boolean value is a truth-value: it specifies whether the condition is true or not.
                                        Comparisons you make in your scripts always have a Boolean outcome. Consider the following line of JavaScript code.
                                        <pre>
                                        y = (x == 2000);
                                        </pre>

                                        Here, the value of the variable x is compared to the number 2000. If it is, the result of the comparison is the Boolean value true, which is assigned to the variable y. If x is not equal to 2000, then the result of the comparison is the Boolean value false. +
                                        Boolean values are especially useful in control structures. The following code combines a comparison that creates a Boolean value directly with a statement that uses it. Consider the following JavaScript code sample.

                                        <pre>
                                        if (x == 2000) {  
                                            z = z + 1;  
                                        }  
                                        else {  
                                            x = x + 1;  
                                        }
                                        </pre>

                                        The if/else statement in JavaScript performs one action if a Boolean value is true (z = z + 1), and an alternate action if the Boolean value is false (x = x + 1).
                                        You can use any expression as a comparative expression. Any expression that evaluates to 0, null, undefined, or an empty string is interpreted as false. An expression that evaluates to any other value is interpreted as true. For example, you could use an expression such as:

                                        <pre>
                                        // This may not do what you expect. See below!  
                                        if (x = y + z)   
                                        </pre>

                                        Note that the above line does not check whether x is equal to y + z, since only a single equal sign (the assignment operator) is used. Instead, the code above assigns the value of y + z to the variable x, and then checks whether the result of the entire expression (the value of x) is zero. To check whether x is equal to y + z, you need to use the following code.

                                        <pre>
                                        // This is different from the code above!  
                                        if (x == y + z)
                                        </pre>

                                    JavaScript includes two additional primitive type values - null and undefined, that can be assigned to a variable that has special meaning. <br>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                                        
                                        <li><b>Null</b></li><br>
                                        You can assign null to a variable to denote that currently that variable does not have any value but it will have later on. A null means absence of a value.
                                        <pre>
                                        var myVar = null;
                                        alert(myVar); // null 
                                        </pre>
                                        In the above example, null is assigned to a variable myVar. It means we have defined a variable but have not assigned any value yet, so value is absence.<br>
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        If you try to find DOM element using document.getElelementByID for example, and if element is found then it will return null. So it is recommended to check for null before doing something with that element.
                                        <pre>
                                        var saveButton = document.getElementById("save");
                                        
                                        if (saveButton !== null)
                                                saveButton.submit();
                                        </pre>
                                        <br>
                                        A null value evaluates to false in conditional expression. So you don't have to use comparison operators like === or !== to check for null values.
                                        <pre>
                                        var myVar = null;

                                        if (myVar)
                                            alert("myVar is not null');
                                        else
                                            alert("myVar is null" );
                                        </pre>
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <li><b>Undefined</b></li><br>
                                        Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
                                        <pre>
                                        var myVar;

                                        alert(myVar); // undefined 
                                        </pre>
                                        In the above example, we have not assigned any value to a variable named 'myVar'. A variable 'myVar' lacks a value. So it is undefined.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.
                                        <pre>
                                        function Sum(val1, val2)
                                        {
                                            var result = val1 + val2;
                                        }

                                        var result = Sum(5, 5);
                                        alert(result);// undefined 
                                        </pre>
                                        In the above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value.
                                        <pre>
                                        function Sum(val1, val2)
                                        {
                                            return val1 + val2;  // val2 is undefined 
                                        }

                                        Sum(5);
                                        </pre>
                                        <br>
                                        An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.
                                        <pre>
                                        var myVar;

                                        if (myVar)
                                            alert("myVar evaluates to true");
                                        else
                                            alert("myVar evaluates to false");
                                        </pre>
                                        <br>
                                        </ul>
                                    
                                        Null and Undefined is one of the main reasons to produce a runtime error in the JavaScript application. This happens if you don't check the value of unknown return variables before using it. If you are not sure that a variable will always have some value, the best practice is to check the value of variables for null or undefined before using them.<br>
