                                        The variable statement declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

                                        Variable declarations, wherever they occur, are processed before any code is executed.
                                        The scope of a variable declared with var is its current execution context, which is either the
                                        enclosing function or, for variables declared outside any function, global. If you re-declare a
                                        JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.

                                        JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

                                        In programming, text values are called text strings.

                                        JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

                                        Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

                                        If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

                                    <h5>Assigning two variables with single string value</h5>
                                    <pre>
                                        var a = 'A';
                                        var b = a;

                                        // Equivalent to:

                                        var a, b = a = 'A';
                                    </pre>

                                    <h5>Be mindful of the order:</h5>
                                    <pre>
                                        var x = y, y = 'A';

                                        Here, x and y are declared before any code is executed, the assignments occur later. At the
                                        time "x = y" is evaluated, y exists so no ReferenceError is thrown and its value is 'undefined'.
                                        So, x is assigned the undefined value. Then, y is assigned a value of 'A'. Consequently, after the
                                        first line, x === undefined && y === 'A', hence the result.

                                        The let statement declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

                                        let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block,
                                        statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword,
                                        which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

                                    <p>When used inside a block, let limits the variable's scope to that block.

                                        Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement.
                                        The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be redeclared.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This declaration creates a constant that can be either global or local to the
                                        function in which it is declared. An initializer for a constant is required; that
                                        is, you must specify its value in the same statement in which it's declared (which makes sense, given that it can't be changed later).

                                        The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean
                                        the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.
                                        For instance, in case the content is an object, this means the object itself can still be altered.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope.
                                    </p>
