                    <b>Histor of Javascript</b>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, when Eich was working for Netscape Communications Corporation. The technology was first called Mocha, then LiveScript. Eventually it was named JavaScript to follow the marketing of another programming language called Java. Java was developed by Sun Microsystems and is a completely different programming language and technology. JavaScript was a competitive technology to VBScript, a Microsoft product. While VBScript worked only on the Internet Explorer browser, JavaScript was supported on other browsers, too. This made JavaScript a preferred language for global applications, and it eventually pushed out VBScript from the web development market.
