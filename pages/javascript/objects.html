                                            <p>Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can
                                                be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in
                                                JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.

                                                In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and
                                                type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with
                                                properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made
                                                of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which
                                                define their characteristics.</p>

                                <p>
                                    A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object
                                    can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties
                                    are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the
                                    attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of
                                    the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
                                </p>
                                <p class="breadcrumb">objectName.propertyName
                                </p>

                                <p>Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal
                                    variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by
                                    assigning it a value. For example, let's create an object named myCar and give
                                    it properties named make, model, and year as follows:</p>

                                <code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
                                        <pre>
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;</pre>
                                </code>


                                <p>Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).</p>
                                <p class="breadcrumb">myCar.color; // undefined
                                </p>
                                <p>There are 3 ways of defining an object from ECMAScript 6 onwards:</p>

                                <ul class="list-group">
                                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>var</strong> keyword</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>let</strong> keyword</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>const</strong> keyword</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket
                                    notation (for more details see property accessors). Objects are sometimes called
                                    associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that
                                    can be used to access it. So, for example, you could access the properties of
                                    the myCar object as follows:
                                </p>


                                <code class="language-html" data-lang="html" style="width: 300px;!important;">
                                        <pre class="nt">
myCar['make'] = 'Ford';
myCar['model'] = 'Mustang';
myCar['year'] = 1969;</pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>
                                    An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can
                                    be converted to a string, including the empty string. However, any property name
                                    that is not a valid JavaScript identifier (for example, a property name that has
                                    a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a number) can only be accessed using
                                    the square bracket notation. This notation is also very useful when property
                                    names are to be dynamically determined (when the property name is not determined
                                    until runtime). Examples are as follows:
                                </p>
                                <code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
                                        <pre>
// four variables are created and assigned in a single go,
// separated by commas
var myObj = new Object(),
str = 'myString',
rand = Math.random(),
obj = new Object();
myObj.type              = 'Dot syntax';
myObj['date created']   = 'String with space';
myObj[str]              = 'String value';
myObj[rand]             = 'Random Number';
myObj[obj]              = 'Object';
myObj['']               = 'Even an empty string';
console.log(myObj);
                                            </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>Please note that all keys in the square bracket notation are converted to String
                                    type, since objects in JavaScript can only have String type as key type. For
                                    example, in the above code, when the key obj is added to the myObj, JavaScript
                                    will call the obj.toString() method, and use this result string as the new key.

                                    You can also access properties by using a string value that is stored in a
                                    variable:</p>
                                <code><pre>
var propertyName = 'make';
myCar[propertyName] = 'Ford';

propertyName = 'model';
myCar[propertyName] = 'Mustang';
                                    </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>You can use the bracket notation with for...in to iterate over all the enumerable
                                    properties of an object. To illustrate how this works, the following function
                                    displays the properties of the object when you pass the object and the object's
                                    name as arguments to the function:</p>

                                <code>
                                        <pre>
function showProps(obj, objName) {
  var result = '';
  for (var i in obj) {
    // obj.hasOwnProperty() is used to filter out properties from the object's prototype chain
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
      result += objName + '.' + i + ' = ' + obj[i] + '\n';
    }
  }
  return result;
}
                                        </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>So, the function call showProps(myCar, "myCar") would return the following:</p>
                                <code><pre>
myCar.make = Ford
myCar.model = Mustang
myCar.year = 1969

                                </code>

                                    <p>Before ECMAScript 5, there was no native way to list all properties of an object.
                                        However, this can be achieved with the following function:</p>
                                    <code>
                                        <pre>
function listAllProperties(o) {
	var objectToInspect;
	var result = [];

	for(objectToInspect = o; objectToInspect !== null; objectToInspect = Object.getPrototypeOf(objectToInspect)) {
      result = result.concat(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(objectToInspect));
	}

	return result;
}
                                        </pre>
                                    </code>

                                    <p>This can be useful to reveal "hidden" properties (properties in the prototype
                                        chain which are not accessible through the object, because another property has
                                        the same name earlier in the prototype chain). Listing accessible properties
                                        only can easily be done by removing duplicates in the array.</p>

                                <p>JavaScript has a number of predefined objects. In addition, you can create your
                                    own objects. You can create an object using an object initializer.
                                    Alternatively, you can first create a constructor function and then instantiate
                                    an object invoking that function in conjunction with the new operator.</p>
                                <h2>Using object initializers

                                </h2>

                                <p>In addition to creating objects using a constructor function, you can create
                                    objects using an object initializer. Using object initializers is sometimes
                                    referred to as creating objects with literal notation. "Object initializer" is
                                    consistent with the terminology used by C++.

                                    The syntax for an object using an object initializer is:</p>
                                <code>
                                        <pre>
var obj = { property_1:   value_1,   // property_# may be an identifier...
            2:            value_2,   // or a number...
            // ...,
            'property n': value_n }; // or a string
                                        </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>
                                    where obj is the name of the new object, each property_i is an identifier
                                    (either a name, a number, or a string literal), and each value_i is an
                                    expression whose value is assigned to the property_i. The obj and assignment is
                                    optional; if you do not need to refer to this object elsewhere, you do not need
                                    to assign it to a variable. (Note that you may need to wrap the object literal
                                    in parentheses if the object appears where a statement is expected, so as not to
                                    have the literal be confused with a block statement.)

                                    Object initializers are expressions, and each object initializer results in a
                                    new object being created whenever the statement in which it appears is executed.
                                    Identical object initializers create distinct objects that will not compare to
                                    each other as equal. Objects are created as if a call to new Object() were made;
                                    that is, objects made from object literal expressions are instances of Object.

                                    The following statement creates an object and assigns it to the variable x if
                                    and only if the expression cond is true:
                                </p>
                                <p class="breadcrumb">if (cond) var x = {greeting: 'hi there'};
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The following example creates myHonda with three properties. Note that the engine
                                    property is also an object with its own properties.
                                </p>

                                <p class="breadcrumb">var myHonda = {color: 'red', wheels: 4, engine: {cylinders: 4,
                                    size: 2.2}};
                                </p>

                                You can also use object initializers to create arrays. See array literals.

                                <h2>Using a constructor function</h2>

                                <p>Alternatively, you can create an object with these two steps:</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Define the object type by writing a constructor function. There is a strong
                                        convention, with good reason, to use a capital initial letter.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Create an instance of the object with <code>new</code>.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>To define an object type, create a function for the object type that specifies its
                                    name, properties, and methods. For example, suppose you want to create an object
                                    type for cars. You want this type of object to be called <code>car</code>, and you
                                    want it to have properties for make, model, and year. To do this, you would write
                                    the following function:</p>

                                <code>
                                        <pre>
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

                                        </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>
                                    Notice the use of this to assign values to the object's properties based on the
                                    values passed to the function.


                                </p>
                                <p>Now you can create an object called mycar as follows:</p>

                                <p class="breadcrumb">var mycar = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This statement creates mycar and assigns it the specified values for its properties.
                                    Then the value of mycar.make is the string "Eagle", mycar.year is the integer 1993,
                                    and so on.


                                </p>
                                <p> You can create any number of car objects by calls to new. For example,</p>

                                <code><pre>
var kenscar = new Car('Nissan', '300ZX', 1992);
var vpgscar = new Car('Mazda', 'Miata', 1990);
                                    </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>An object can have a property that is itself another object. For example, suppose you
                                    define an object called person as follows:</p>

                                <code>
                                        <pre>
function Person(name, age, sex) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.sex = sex;
}
                                        </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>and then instantiate two new person objects as follows:</p>

                                <code><pre>
var rand = new Person('Rand McKinnon', 33, 'M');
var ken = new Person('Ken Jones', 39, 'M');
                                    </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>Then, you can rewrite the definition of car to include an owner property that takes a
                                    person object, as follows:</p>

                                <code>
                                        <pre>
function Car(make, model, year, owner) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.owner = owner;
}
                                        </pre>

                                </code>
                                <p>To instantiate the new objects, you then use the following:</p>

                                <code>
                                        <pre>
var car1 = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993, rand);
var car2 = new Car('Nissan', '300ZX', 1992, ken);
                                        </pre>
                                </code>

                                <p>Notice that instead of passing a literal string or integer value when creating the
                                    new objects, the above statements pass the objects rand and ken as the arguments for
                                    the owners. Then if you want to find out the name of the owner of car2, you can
                                    access the following property:</p>
                                <p class="breadcrumb">car2.owner.name
                                </p>

                                <p>Note that you can always add a property to a previously defined object. For example,
                                    the statement</p>
                                <p class="breadcrumb">car1.color = 'black';
                                </p>

                                <p>adds a property color to car1, and assigns it a value of "black." However, this does
                                    not affect any other objects. To add the new property to all objects of the same
                                    type, you have to add the property to the definition of the car object type.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                                    Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be
                                    very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you
                                    want to create, without having to define a constructor function.
