                                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. In simple terms, HTML constructs web pages.
                                    Hypertext means that documents are designed to be linked to other documents on the web.
                                    Next is HTML being a markup language which are the set of tags that are added to the
                                    text of a webpage to define its structure which are critical roles. First, it defines
                                    the role each piece of content will have. Some content will become the main headline,
                                    while other content links in the navigation. Some tags describe non-textual elements and so on.

                                    It's Time Berners-Lee! Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the Web. In 1989, Tim was
                                    working in a computing services section of CERN when he came up with the concept;
                                    at the time he had no idea that it would be implemented on such an enormous scale.
                                    Particle physics research often involves collaboration among institutes from all over
                                    the world. Tim had the idea of enabling researchers from remote sites in the world to
                                    organize and pool together information. But far from simply making available a large
                                    number of research documents as files that could be downloaded to individual computers,
                                    he suggested that you could actually link the text in the files themselves.
                                    In other words, there could be cross-references from one research paper to another.
                                    This would mean that while reading one research paper, you could quickly display part
                                    of another paper that holds directly relevant text or diagrams. Documentation of a
                                    scientific and mathematical nature would thus be represented as a `web' of information
                                    held in electronic form on computers across the world. This, Tim thought, could be
                                    done by using some form of hypertext, some way of linking documents together by using
                                    buttons on the screen, which you simply clicked on to jump from one paper to another.
                                    Before coming to CERN, Tim had already worked on document production and text processing,
                                    and had developed his first hypertext system, `Enquire', in 1980 for his own personal use.
