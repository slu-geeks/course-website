                    <h3>What are Servlets?</h3>
                    &nbsp; Java Servlets are programs that run on a Web or Application server and act as a middle layer
                    between
                    a request coming from a Web browser or other HTTP client and databases or applications on the HTTP
                    server. Using Servlets, you can collect input from users through web page forms, present records
                    from a database or another source, and create web pages dynamically.

                                    &nbsp; A servlet life cycle can be defined as the entire process from its creation
                                    till the
                                    destruction.
                                    The following are the paths followed by a servlet
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The servlet is initialized by calling the <b>init ()</b> method.</li>
                                        <li>The servlet calls <b>service()</b> method to process a client's request.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The servlet is terminated by calling the <b>destroy()</b> method.</li>
                                        <li>Finally, servlet is garbage collected by the garbage collector of the JVM.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>The init() method</b><br/>
                                            The init method is designed to be called only once. It is called when the
                                            servlet is
                                            first created, and not called again for each user request. So, it is used
                                            for one-time
                                            initializations, just as with the init method of applets.

                                            <br/><br/>

                                            The servlet is normally created when a user first invokes a URL
                                            corresponding to the
                                            servlet, but you can also specify that the servlet be loaded when the server
                                            is first
                                            started.

                                            <br/><br/>

                                            When a user invokes a servlet, a single instance of each servlet gets
                                            created, with each
                                            user request resulting in a new thread that is handed off to doGet or doPost
                                            as appropriate.
                                            The init() method simply creates or loads some data that will be used
                                            throughout the life of
                                            the servlet.

                                            <br/><br/>

                                            The init method definition looks like this:<br/>
                                            <pre>
                                            public void init() throws ServletException {
                                                // Initialization code...
                                            }</pre>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>The service() method</b><br/>
                                            The service() method is the main method to perform the actual task. The
                                            servlet container
                                            (i.e. web server) calls the service() method to handle requests coming from
                                            the client(
                                            browsers) and to write the formatted response back to the client.

                                            <br/><br/>

                                            Each time the server receives a request for a servlet, the server spawns a
                                            new thread and
                                            calls service. The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST,
                                            PUT, DELETE,
                                            etc.) and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate.

                                            <br/><br/>

                                            Here is the signature of this method:<br/>
                                            <pre>
                                            public void service(ServletRequest request,
                                                                ServletResponse response)
                                                  throws ServletException, IOException{
                                            }</pre>

                                            The service () method is called by the container and service method invokes
                                            doGet, doPost,
                                            doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate. So you have nothing to do with
                                            service()
                                            method but you override either doGet() or doPost() depending on what type of
                                            request you
                                            receive from the client.

                                            <br/><br/>

                                            The doGet() and doPost() are most frequently used methods with in each
                                            service request. Here
                                            is the signature of these two methods.

                                    </ol>

                                    Here's one possibility: there are mistakes in your HTML and the browser has fixed
                                    them for you. Let's say you have a &lt;table&gt; element in your HTML and leave out
                                    the
                                    required &lt;tbody&gt; element. The browser will just insert that &lt;tbody&gt; for
                                    you. It will
                                    be there in the DOM, so you'll be able to find it with JavaScript and style it with
                                    CSS, even though it's not in your HTML.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>Javascript</b> can manipulate the DOM. For example in your HTML, we have:
                                    <pre>
                                        &lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                                    </pre>
                                    Then later in your HTML, there is a bit of JavaScript:
                                    <pre>
                                        &lt;script&gt;
                                          var container = document.getElementById("container");
                                          container.innerHTML = "New Content!";
                                        &lt;/script&gt;
                                    </pre>
                                    On the screen you'll see "New Content!" rather than nothing, because that empty div
                                    was filled with some a new content.If you use DevTools to check out the visual
                                    representation of the DOM, you'll see:
                                    <pre>
                                        &lt;div id="container"&gt;New Content! &lt;/div&gt;
                                    </pre>
                                    Which is different than your original HTML or what you would see in View Source.

                                    The DOM originated as a specification to allow JavaScript scripts and Java programs
                                    to
                                    be portable among Web browsers. "Dynamic HTML" was the immediate ancestor of the
                                    Document
                                    Object Model, and it was originally thought of largely in terms of browsers.
                                    However,
                                    when the DOM Working Group was formed at W3C, it was also joined by vendors in other
                                    domains, including HTML or XML editors and document repositories. Several of these
                                    vendors had worked with SGML before XML was developed; as a result, the DOM has been
                                    influenced by SGML Groves and the HyTime standard. Some of these vendors had also
                                    developed their own object models for documents in order to provide an API for
                                    SGML/XML
                                    editors or document repositories, and these object models have also influenced the
                                    DOM.

                                    The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language
                                    wouldn't
                                    have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their
                                    component
                                    parts (e.g. elements). Every element in a document—the document as a whole, the
                                    head,
                                    tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells—is part of
                                    the
                                    document object model for that document, so they can all be accessed and manipulated
                                    using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.<br/><br/>

                                    In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually
                                    they evolved into separate entities. The page content is stored in the DOM and may
                                    be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, so that we may write this approximative
                                    equation: <br/><br/>

                                    API (HTML or XML page) = DOM + JS (scripting language)
