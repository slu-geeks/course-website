                    <b>REPONSE</b>
                    <p>
                        After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message.

                    <p>
                        ------ sample format here -------
                    </p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li><b>Status-Line</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line, consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase, with each element separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.
                        </p>

                        <p>Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Status Code and Reason Phrase</li>
                            <p>
                                The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request. The Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the Status-Code. The Status-Code is intended for use by automata and the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. The client is not required to examine or display the Reason- Phrase.The request method indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive and should always be mentioned in uppercase.
                            </p>
                        </ul>

                        <li><b>Response Header Fields</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line. These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.
                        </p>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
