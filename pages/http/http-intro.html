                            The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

                        <li><b>Purpose</b></li>
                        <p>Since 1990 the HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative. The HTTP/0.9, the first version of HTTP, was simple protocol for raw data transfer accros the Internet. HTTP 1.0 improved the protocol by allowing mesages to be in the format of MIME-like messages, containing metainformation about the data transferred and modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual hosts.</p>

                        <p>HTTP allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the purpose of a request. It builds on the discipline of reference provided by the Unifromat Resource Identifier (URI), as a location (URL) or name (URN), for indiciating the resource to which a method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to that used by Internet mail as defined by the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).</p>

                        <p>HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between user agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet systems, including those supported by the SMTP, NNTP, FTP, Gopher, and WAIS protocols. In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia access to resources available from diverse applications.

                            <b>Overall Operation</b>
                            <p>The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol. A client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followd by a MIME-like message contatining request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a connection with a server. The server responds with a status line, including the messages's protocol version and a success information, entity metainformation, and possible entity-body content. </p>

                            <p>HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used. This does not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used.</p>
