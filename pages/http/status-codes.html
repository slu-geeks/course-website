            <b>What are HTTP Status Codes</b>
            <p>
                HTTP Status Codes are 3-digit integers where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>1xx: Informational</dt>
                <dd>- It means the request has been received and the process is continuing.</dd>
                <dt>2xx: Success</dt>
                <dd>- It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</dd>
                <dt>3xx: Redirection</dt>
                <dd>- It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.</dd>
                <dt>4xx: Client Error</dt>
                <dd>- It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.</dd>
                <dt>5xx: Server Error</dt>
                <dd>- It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.</dd>
            </dl>
