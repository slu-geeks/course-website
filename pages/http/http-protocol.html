                            <b>HTTP Version</b>
                            <p>HTTP uses a "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;" numbering scheme to indicate versions of the protocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow the sender to indicate format of a message and its capacity for understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features obtained via that communication.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Uniform Resource Identifiers</b>
                            <p>URIs have been known by many names: WWW addresses, Universal Document Identifiers, Universal Resource Identifiers, and finally the combination of Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and Names (URN). As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource Identifiers are simply formatted strings which identify--via name, location, or any other characteristics--a resource.</p>

                                <li><b>General Syntax</b>
                                    <p>URIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some known base URI, depending upon the context of their use. The two forms are differentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always begin with a scheme name followed by a colon. </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP protocol. This. </p>
                                    <p>http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]</p>

                                    <p>The following three URIs are equivalent:</p>

                            <ol type=a>
                                <li><b>Full Date</b><p>HTTP application have historically three different formats for the representation of date/time stamps:</p>
                                    <p>Mon, 06 Dec 1997 08:49:37 GMT<br>
                                        Monday, 06-Dec-97 08:49:37 GMT<br>
                                        Mon Dec &nbsp;6 08:49:37 1994</p>
                                    <p>The first format is preffered as an Internet standard and represents a fixed-length subset. The second format is obsolete date format because it lacks a four-digit year.</p>
                                    <p>All HTTP date/time stamps must be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP, GMT is exactly equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). </p></li>

                                <li><b>Delta Seconds</b></li>
                                <p>Some HTTP header fields allow a time value to be specified as an integer number of seconds, represented in decimal, after the time that the message was received.</p>
                                <p>

                            <p>HTTP uses the same definition of the term "character set" as that described for MIME:</p>
                            <p>The term "character set" is used in this document to refer to a method used with one or more tables to convert a sequence of octets into a sequence of characters.

                            <p>Transfer-coding values are used to indicate an encoding transformation that has been, can be, or may need to applied to an entity-body in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network.</p>
