                    <b>REPONSE</b>
                    <p>
                        After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message.

                    <pre>
                        Response      = Status-Line          
                       *(( general-header        
                        | response-header        
                        | entity-header ) CRLF)
                       CRLF
                       [ message-body ]        
                    </pre>
                    
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li><b>Status-Line</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line, consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase, with each element separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.
                        </p>

                        <p>Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Status Code and Reason Phrase</li>
                            <p>
                                The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request. The Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the Status-Code. The Status-Code is intended for use by automata and the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. The client is not required to examine or display the Reason- Phrase.The request method indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive and should always be mentioned in uppercase.
                            </p>
                        </ul>

                        <li><b>Response Header Fields</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line. These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                        response-header = Accept-Ranges           
                       | Age                    
                       | ETag                  
                       | Location                
                       | Proxy-Authenticate 
                       | Retry-After          
                       | Server               
                       | Vary                
                       | WWW-Authenticate    
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                        Response-header field names can be extended reliably only in combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or experimental header fields MAY be given the semantics of response- header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to be response-header fields. Unrecognized header fields are treated as entity-header fields.
                        </p>
