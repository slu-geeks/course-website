                                    HTML we write is not not really the DOM itself, but the HTML you write is parsed by the browser
                                    and turned into the DOM. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
                                    The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects: <br/><br/>
                                    <div style="text-align: center">
                                        <img src="../../public/img/dom.gif">
                                    </div>
                                    <br/>
                                    With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page</li>
                                    </ul>


                                </div>
                            </div>

                        <div class="panel panel-default">
                            <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingTwo">

                                        When is the DOM different than the HTML?

                                    Here's one possibility: there are mistakes in your HTML and the browser has fixed
                                    them for you. Let's say you have a &lt;table&gt; element in your HTML and leave out the
                                    required &lt;tbody&gt; element. The browser will just insert that &lt;tbody&gt; for you. It will
                                    be there in the DOM, so you'll be able to find it with JavaScript and style it with
                                    CSS, even though it's not in your HTML.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <b>Javascript</b> can manipulate the DOM. For example in your HTML, we have:
                                    <pre>
                                        &lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                                    </pre>
                                    Then later in your HTML, there is a bit of JavaScript:
                                    <pre>
                                        &lt;script&gt;
                                          var container = document.getElementById("container");
                                          container.innerHTML = "New Content!";
                                        &lt;/script&gt;
                                    </pre>
                                    On the screen you'll see "New Content!" rather than nothing, because that empty div
                                    was filled with some a new content.If you use DevTools to check out the visual
                                    representation of the DOM, you'll see:
                                    <pre>
                                        &lt;div id="container"&gt;New Content! &lt;/div&gt;
                                    </pre>
                                    Which is different than your original HTML or what you would see in View Source.

                                    The DOM originated as a specification to allow JavaScript scripts and Java programs to
                                    be portable among Web browsers. "Dynamic HTML" was the immediate ancestor of the Document
                                    Object Model, and it was originally thought of largely in terms of browsers. However,
                                    when the DOM Working Group was formed at W3C, it was also joined by vendors in other
                                    domains, including HTML or XML editors and document repositories. Several of these
                                    vendors had worked with SGML before XML was developed; as a result, the DOM has been
                                    influenced by SGML Groves and the HyTime standard. Some of these vendors had also
                                    developed their own object models for documents in order to provide an API for SGML/XML
                                    editors or document repositories, and these object models have also influenced the DOM.

                                        DOM and JavaScript

                                    The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't
                                    have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their component
                                    parts (e.g. elements). Every element in a document—the document as a whole, the head,
                                    tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells—is part of the
                                    document object model for that document, so they can all be accessed and manipulated
                                    using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.<br/><br/>

                                    In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually
                                    they evolved into separate entities. The page content is stored in the DOM and may
                                    be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, so that we may write this approximative
                                    equation: <br/><br/>

                                    API (HTML or XML page) = DOM + JS (scripting language)
